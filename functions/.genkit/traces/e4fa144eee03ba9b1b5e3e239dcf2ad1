In order to be eligible for the end-semester examination of a course unit, a student \\nmust have at least sat for the end-semester exam of each of the prerequisite course \\nunits (irrespective of the grade obtained), if any, listed under that course unit.  \\n3. A student should maintain 80% attendance in each course unit in order to become \\neligible  for  the  end-semester  examination  of  that  particular  course  unit.  If  the \\nattendance falls below 50%, the student is considered to  have failed the course \\nunit and the student may sit for the end-semester exam in the following academic \\nyear and it will be considered the student’s second attempt at the exam. If the \\nattendance lies between 50% and 80%, a student may become eligible for the end-\\nsemester  exam  as  recommended by  the  instructor  in  charge  of  the  course  unit \\n(based on additional assessment procedures set by the instructor to evaluate the \\nstudent’s competence in the course unit).  \\n \\n \\n  \"","genkit:state":"success"},"displayName":"extract-text","links":[],"instrumentationLibrary":{"name":"genkit-tracer","version":"v1"},"spanKind":"INTERNAL","sameProcessAsParentSpan":{"value":true},"status":{"code":0},"timeEvents":{"timeEvent":[]}},"690fa04ea69ee1d2":{"spanId":"690fa04ea69ee1d2","traceId":"e4fa144eee03ba9b1b5e3e239dcf2ad1","parentSpanId":"eb5994db214abeaf","startTime":1734855172771,"endTime":1734855172775.7043,"attributes":{"genkit:type":"flowStep","genkit:name":"chunk-it","genkit:path":"/{indexCsBook,t:action}/{indexCsBook,t:flow}/{chunk-it,t:flowStep}","genkit:output":"[\"\\n 117 | P a g e \\n 118 | P a g e \\n DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGY \\n Degree Programs: \\n  Bachelor of Science in Physical Sciences \\n  Bachelor of Science Honours in Applied Physics \\n  Bachelor of Science Honours in Chemical Technology \\n  Bachelor of Science Honours in Computer Science and Technology \\n Anticipated Graduate Profile \\n Bachelor of Science in Physical Sciences \\n Bachelor of Science Honours in Applied Physics \\n 119 | P a g e \\n Bachelor of Science Honours in Chemical Technology \\n Bachelor of Science Honours in Computer Science and Technology \\n\",\" Science Honours in Chemical Technology \\n Bachelor of Science Honours in Computer Science and Technology \\n Guideline for Course Codes and Credits \\n A course code contains, abbreviation to the name of degree program, year of study, \\n semester of study, number of credits assigned for the subject and the subject code \\n respectively.
